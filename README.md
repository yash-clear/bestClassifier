# Prediction using Supervised ML (Task-1) - By Yashaswita Singh 
## loan_data_classifier
Classification is one of the classical problems in Supervised Learning where we attempt to train a model to classify data points into *n* distinct classes.
This end-to-end Machine Learning project is primarily based on Python. I have used the following libraries to help me achieve the objective:
1. Numpy for mathematical operations.
2. Pandas for data exploration and analysis
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
4. Scikit-learn for model training, cross-validation, and evaluation metrics.
